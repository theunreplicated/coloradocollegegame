# Introduction #

Explain the benefits of using Google SketchUp to model our world.


# Details #

Google !Sketchup has many design features that will allow for us to create models quickly, and anyone can create these models from their own home. The best way to possibly import said files will be using an xml type language.

The Free Version of [Google Sketchup](http://sketchup.google.com/index.html) has an option to export the 3D model into many different file types. The one to use will be the .kmz file extension as both the **Free** and Professional can export this file type.

Also by using the default .kmz file extension we are able to use Google's very own [3D Warehouse](http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/) to be able to import a very vast amount of objects into our worlds. There are currently thousands (if not millions) of different models we can use.

To get a model into our world from the [3D Warehouse](http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/) just follow these simple instructions:

Option 1 - using a browser

  1. Find and Download the model that you wish to use within the browser of your choice.
  1. Open the model in the latest version of [SketchUp](http://sketchup.google.com/download.html)
  1. Export to a .kmz file by: File > Export > 3D Model...  the export model to use is Google Earth (.kmz)


Option 2 - SketchUp

  1. Within SketchUp: File > 3D Warehouse > Get Models...
  1. Find the model you wish to use. It acts like a browser for the warehouse.
  1. Select Download model and Select "Yes" to the dialog box that pops up.
  1. Export to a .kmz file by: File > Export > 3D Model...  the export model to use is Google Earth (.kmz)


Have fun with the Google Library!
